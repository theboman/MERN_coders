# MERN_coders
full stack MERN example with auth


This is an example of a full stack website

demonstrates:
 - Both front end and back end. React.js (frontend) Node and Express (backend)
 - Node REST fixed end points (would like to implement Graph)
 - React pre-hooks yep old school class and functional components
 - REDUX for global state.
 - using JWT tokens for auth
 
After this project the main areas I would evaluate is the database, and the use of Redux. The database relationship
structures, still need to be pretty well defined ahead of time otherwise a few iterations of messy data. Graph database 
are interesting in that relations can be defined after the fact more easily. Neo4J or even more exciting is Fauna.

Hooks pretty much eliminated the need for Redux, a lot of boiler plate coding is necessary to implement. Would rather use Hooks.
