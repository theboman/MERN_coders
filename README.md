# MERN_coders
full stack MERN example with auth


This is an example of a full stack website

demonstrates:
 - Both front end and back end. React.js (frontend) Node and Express (backend)
 - Node REST fixed end points (would like to implement Graph)
 - React pre-hooks yep old school class and functional components
 - REDUX for global state.
 - using JWT tokens for auth
 
After this project the main areas I would evaluate are the database namely, relationship
structures. Graph database are interesting in that relations can be defined after the fact,
Neo4J or even more exciting is Fauna.
